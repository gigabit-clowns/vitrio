/**
 * @brief Abstract read-only view of one image file.
 *
 * A reader is opened over one image file and exposes its contents as one
 * rectangular ND array. Every read is a set of hyperrectangles of that
 * array, which is the only access pattern there is: image @c i of an
 * @c (N,H,W) stack is the region of extents @c (H,W) at offset @c (i,0,0),
 * a patch of an @c (H,W) micrograph is the region of extents @c (h,w) at
 * offset @c (y,x), and a whole volume is the region covering everything.
 * Reading in a random or in a sequential order is a property of a sequence
 * of calls rather than of one, so it is nothing a reader distinguishes.
 *
 * A read takes every region at once rather than one at a time. That is the
 * only shape in which a reader can see enough to order and merge the
 * accesses it is about to make, and it keeps the per region cost to
 * arithmetic.
 *
 * Everything a reader reports is fixed when it is opened, and reading does
 * not change it.

	/**
	 * @brief Read a set of hyperrectangles of the file into one array.
	 *
	 * The file is the file side of the plan and @p destination its array
	 * side: every region names where it starts in the file and where it
	 * lands in @p destination, and all of them share the extents the
	 * plan carries. Passing every region in one call is what lets a
	 * reader sort the regions by their position on the storage and merge
	 * neighbouring ones into a single larger read, which one call per region
	 * can not express; it also pays for the destination's geometry once
	 * rather than once per region.
	 *
	 * @p destination is the whole array, not a view of the part a region
	 * lands in, and it may be strided. The file offsets of the plan must have
	 * the rank of the file and its array offsets the rank of
	 * @p destination; a side whose rank exceeds that of the extents spans a
	 * single position along the axes they do not reach.
	 *
	 * Regions may be read in any order. If two of them land on the same
	 * elements of @p destination, which one prevails is unspecified and thus
	 * this pattern should be avoided.
	 *
	 * Values are converted to the data type of @p destination as a cast
	 * between the two types does, which preserves the numeric value where
	 * the destination can hold it.
	 * Nothing is scaled, normalised or clipped, whatever statistics the file
	 * may carry in its header; asking for the data type of
	 * @ref get_descriptor converts nothing at all.
	 *
	 * @par Thread safety
	 * This method may be called concurrently on one reader. A reader that
	 * can not decode in parallel serialises the calls itself, so issuing
	 * them at once never costs correctness.
	 *
	 * An empty plan reads nothing and succeeds.
	 *
	 * @param destination Where the regions are written. Must be
	 * initialized.
	 * @param regions The regions to read and where each one lands.
	 * @throws std::invalid_argument If the file offsets do not have the
	 * rank of the file, if the array offsets do not have the rank of
	 * @p destination, or if @p destination is not initialized.
	 * @throws std::out_of_range If a region is not contained in the file,
	 * or does not fit in @p destination where it is placed.
	 * @throws unsupported_operation_error If the data type of @p destination
	 * can not be produced from the one of the file.
	 * @throws image_file_format_error If the file turns out to be malformed
	 * or truncated where a region is read.
