 * @brief The regions to transfer between one file and one array.
 *
 * Every region pairs an offset into the file with an offset into the array,
 * and every region in a plan shares one @ref image_transfer_shape. The two
 * sides are named file and array rather than source and destination, so the
 * same plan describes a read and a write alike.
 *
 * The shape is fixed when a plan is constructed; only the regions come and
 * go.
 *
 * The offsets are held in two @ref index_table rather than one allocation
 * per region, so any number of regions costs a bounded number of
 * allocations, and @ref clear keeps the capacity, so a plan refilled after
 * its first use allocates nothing.
