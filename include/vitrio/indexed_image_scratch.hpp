/**
 * @brief A scratch that holds the images that image_location-s can name, each
 * in a slot of its storage.
 *
 * What it holds of a file are indices of the first axis of the file, which
 * is what an @ref image_location names: for example the images of a stack.
 * Each held index has a slot in the storage.
 *
 * It holds the images that a grouping of locations names, as far as they
 * fit in the storage. Each file gets one entry, and the entries are stored
 * one after another. The storage decides where the copies live: in main
 * memory, or in a file mapped into it.
 *
 * Which images are held is fixed at construction. Entries are loaded from
 * their files when regions are stored into them.
 *
 * Loading works in runs. A run is a block of consecutive held images of one
 * file. Every run of a file has the same number of images, except the last
 * one, which may have fewer. Storing any image loads its whole run in one
 * read of the file.
 *
 * The storage also records what is loaded, so that a scratch constructed
 * later over the same storage can continue from it. The storage starts with
 * a fingerprint of how the scratch is laid out: the keys and the held
 * indices, the run length, and the data type and extents of each file.
 * Each run has a flag, which holds the modification time that its file had
 * when the run was loaded. The time is asked of the file system, with the
 * key as the path of the file. A file whose time can not be told is loaded
 * again by every scratch.

	/**
	 * @brief Construct a scratch for a grouping of locations.
	 *
	 * A location with a stack index names that index of the first axis of
	 * its file. A location without one names the whole file.
	 *
	 * Files are taken in the order of the grouping, which is ascending
	 * order of key. Each is opened once, to learn its shape and data type.
	 * If the storage runs out of room, the current file keeps the lowest
	 * indices that fit and the remaining files are not opened.
	 *
	 * @param locations The images to hold, grouped by file.
	 * @param files Provider used to open the files.
	 * @param storage Where the copies are stored. Its size is the capacity
	 * of the scratch. It must be aligned for 64-bit integers and for the
	 * data types of the files.
	 * @param run_length Number of held indices per run. A file that holds
	 * no more indices than this is a single run.
	 * @param mode Whether the scratch starts empty or resumed.
	 * - An empty scratch has nothing loaded, and does not read @p storage.
	 * - A resumed scratch keeps the runs that an earlier scratch loaded
	 * into @p storage, if that scratch had the same fingerprint. A run is
	 * kept only if its file has not been modified since. A file whose
	 * modification time can not be read is never kept. If the fingerprint
	 * differs, the scratch starts empty. The contents of @p storage must be
	 * defined, which those of newly allocated memory are not.
	 * @throws std::invalid_argument If @p storage is null, if it is smaller
	 * than a fingerprint, if it is not aligned for 64-bit integers or for
	 * the data type of a file, or if @p run_length is zero.
	 * @throws std::out_of_range If a location has a stack index that its
	 * file does not have.
	 * @throws image_file_error If a file does not exist or can not be read.
	 * @throws unsupported_operation_error If no format can read a file.
	 * @throws image_file_format_error If a file is malformed or truncated.
