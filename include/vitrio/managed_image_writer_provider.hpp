/**
 * @brief A provider whose files are explicitly declared and closed by the
 * client.
 *
 * Creating a file replaces whatever was there, so a writer dropped and
 * reopened would truncate everything already written to it, and no eviction
 * policy can decide when that is safe. Which files exist and when each is
 * finished is instead said outright, through @ref declare and @ref close.
 *
 * Each file therefore has one lifecycle, **declare, acquire as often as
 * needed, close**:
 * - A declared file is created, through the format selector, the first time
 *   it is acquired, so declaring many files costs no file descriptor until
 *   each is reached. Every later acquire returns that same writer until the
 *   file is closed, and a path never declared is refused with
 *   @c std::out_of_range.
 * - @ref close flushes and drops the writer, which is what gives its file
 *   descriptor back.
 * - @ref flush flushes every writer created so far, and creates none: a
 *   declared file never acquired stays uncreated.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * Every method may be called concurrently. The lock is held while a file is
 * created, since two concurrent calls creating one file would otherwise each
 * replace it, and only long enough to look it up when it is already open.
