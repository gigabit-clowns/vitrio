/**
 * @brief A list of paths in which equal paths are held once.
 *
 * Each entry of the list refers to a path, and entries naming the same path
 * share one copy of it: the distinct paths are held once and the entries are
 * indices into them. A list naming a few paths many times over therefore
 * costs a string per distinct path rather than per entry.
 *
 * The list has two sizes. @ref get_path_count is how many distinct paths
 * were interned and @ref get_entry_count how many entries there are. Each is
 * addressed on its own: @ref get_path takes a path index, @ref get an entry
 * index.
 *
 * @ref clear keeps both capacities, so a list refilled after clearing
 * allocates only the strings of the paths it interns.
