/**
 * @brief A provider that keeps the readers it was last asked for.
 *
 * Opening a file costs a system call and a header read, which asking for
 * the same few files over and over repeats for nothing. This keeps a bounded
 * number of readers open, each under the key it was asked for with, and
 * evicts the least recently asked for when it is full. A key it holds is
 * served without opening anything, and becomes the last to be evicted.
 *
 * It is a **decorator over another provider**, not a second opener: on a
 * miss it asks its backing provider and keeps what it gets, so it caches the
 * readers of any provider alike.
 *
 * The capacity is a file descriptor budget, which is why it is stated in
 * entries rather than in bytes.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * @ref acquire may be called concurrently. The lock is not held while the
 * backing provider opens a file, so two concurrent calls missing on one
 * key may both open it and one of the two readers is kept; that wastes an
 * open and never costs correctness, since either reader serves equally.
 * Handing out @c shared_ptr means the one not kept stays alive as long as it
 * is read through, and so does an evicted one.
