 * files whose shape is already settled rather than creating them from
 * @p source. A stack can therefore be written a batch at a time, several
 * stacks at once, and one batch may span more than one of them.
 *
 * Every slot must fit where it is written: a location naming an index the
 * stack does not hold is reported through the completion rather than
 * dropped. See @ref strict_image_transfer_sanitizer.
 *
 * @param saver Where the writes are dispatched. Needs to outlive this call
 * and no longer, the work outliving it carrying what it needs.
