	 * The mirror of @ref image_reader::read, sharing its plan and naming its
	 * sides the same way: the file is the file side and @p source the array
	 * side, so every region names where it is taken from in @p source and
	 * where it lands in the file, and all of them share the extents the plan
	 * carries. The plan is therefore built the same way for a write as for a
	 * read. Passing every region in one call lets a writer order and merge
	 * the accesses it is about to make, and pays for the source's geometry
	 * once.
	 *
	 * @p source is the whole array and may be strided. Its
	 * rank must be the array rank of the plan and the file's the file rank,
	 * and values are converted as a cast between the two types does, without
	 * scaling or normalising.
	 *
	 * Regions that do not overlap may be written by concurrent calls.
	 * Overlapping ones may not, and where two regions of one call land on the
	 * same elements of the file, which one prevails is unspecified.
	 *
	 * A region that is never written keeps whatever the format leaves in a
	 * file it has laid out but not filled. An empty plan writes nothing
	 * and succeeds.
	 *
	 * @param source The values to write. Must be initialized.
	 * @param regions The regions to write and where each one comes from.
	 * @throws std::invalid_argument If the array offsets do not have the
	 * rank of @p source, if the file offsets do not have the rank of
	 * the file, or if @p source is not initialized.
	 * @throws std::out_of_range If a region is not contained in the file,
	 * or is not contained in @p source where it is taken from.
	 * @throws unsupported_operation_error If the data type of the file can
	 * not be produced from the one of @p source.
