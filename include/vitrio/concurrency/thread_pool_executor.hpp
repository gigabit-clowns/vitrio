/**
 * @brief An executor backed by a fixed pool of worker threads.
 *
 * Every worker pulls the next submitted task from one shared queue,
 * runs it, and reports its outcome to the notifier it was submitted
 * with, catching whatever the task threw. Submitting never blocks the
 * caller and never runs the task itself; a task queued while every
 * worker is busy simply waits its turn. The queue is unbounded.
 *
 * The worker count should track the concurrency the destination the
 * tasks read from or write to actually supports, not the number of CPU
 * cores: a worker mostly blocks in I/O rather than computing.
 *
 * The destructor waits for every already-queued task to run before
 * returning, submitted or not yet started.
 *
 * @par Thread safety
 * submit may be called concurrently.
