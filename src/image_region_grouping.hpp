 * @brief Orders the regions of a transaction plan by the file they

 * Every region of one file ends up together, and regions of one file keep
 * the order they have in the plan.
 *
 * It does not hold the regions, only where they are: @ref get_region maps a
 * position of the ordering to a region of the plan it was built from, which
 * the plan is then asked about. One file is walked with
 *
 * @code
 * const auto first = grouping.get_first_position(file);
 * const auto count = grouping.get_file_region_count(file);
 * for (auto i = first; i < first + count; ++i)
 * {
 *     const auto region = grouping.get_region(i);
 *     plan.get_file_offset(region);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @ref build costs one pass over the regions rather than a comparison sort,
 * and keeps the capacity, so a grouping rebuilt after its first use
 * allocates nothing.
