/**
 * @brief Creates a TIFF file and writes it a page at a time.
 *
 * A file of rank two is one page, and a file of rank three is a stack of
 * them, its first axis running along the pages. Pages of integer samples
 * are compressed with LZW and pages of floating point or complex ones are
 * left as they are. The file is created as BigTIFF when its samples would
 * not be sure to fit in a classic one.
 *
 * A page is encoded as a whole and appended to the file, which is what a
 * compressed file allows and no more. A write is therefore narrower than
 * what @ref image_writer states:
 *
 * - Every region covers whole pages: one page, or a run of consecutive
 *   ones. A region that covers part of a page is refused.
 * - Pages are written in order and once. The regions of one call may be
 *   stated in any order, but together they cover a run of consecutive pages
 *   that begins at the first page not yet written. The file may be written
 *   across any number of calls that follow one another this way.
 * - Concurrent calls are serialised, and one that arrives out of turn is
 *   refused like any other that does not begin at the next page.
 *
 * A call that is refused writes nothing.
 *
 * A page is handed to the operating system by the call that writes it, so
 * nothing is left pending for @ref flush. Pages that are never written are
 * absent from the file, which then holds fewer pages than it was created
 * for; a writer destroyed in that state logs it.
