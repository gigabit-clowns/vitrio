 * @brief Decodes the pages of a TIFF file whose pages are all alike.

 * lets the file be taken for a stack. A page is decoded into memory laid out
 * row after row, whichever way the file cuts it into strips or tiles, and
 * only the blocks holding the rows asked for are decoded.
 *
 * The page decoded last is kept, along with which of its blocks have been
 * decoded, so that asking for more rows of it decodes only the blocks that
 * are still missing. Asking for another page drops it.

 * A decoder is not safe to use from several threads at once.
