/**
 * @brief Reads a TIFF file whose pages are all alike.
 *
 * A file of one page is an image, and a file of several is a stack of them,
 * its first axis running along the pages.
 *
 * The samples of a file are compressed a block at a time, so a region is
 * not addressed where it lies: the blocks holding its rows are decoded and
 * the region is moved out of them. A read decodes a page at a time and only
 * the blocks its regions reach, and the page decoded last is kept, so
 * regions of one page read by successive calls decode each block once.
 *
 * Decoding goes through one handle on the file, so concurrent calls to
 * @ref read are serialised.
