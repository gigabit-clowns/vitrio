 *
 * Integers of one, two, four and eight bytes have a data type, as do
 * floating point numbers of two, four and eight, and complex numbers of two
 * floating point numbers of four or eight bytes each. A complex number of
 * two half precision ones has none, since libtiff does not put its halves
 * in the byte order of the host.

 * @param sample_format How the bits are read, as the SampleFormat tag

 * a pair that has no counterpart this format can transfer, which is every
 * sample narrower than a byte, every width not named above, and complex
 * integers.
