 * @brief The regions of a plan, resolved into those of each page they

 * A TIFF file holds its pages one by one, so regions stated against the
 * whole of it are moved a page at a time. Each page a plan reaches gets the
 * regions that lie on it, stated against that page alone: as offsets into
 * its rows and columns, with the page axis gone. A region that spans
 * several pages becomes one region on each of them, placed one position
 * further along the axis of the array its pages run along.
 *
 * The pages are held in ascending order, and each carries the rows its
 * regions reach, which are all of it that needs decoding.
