 * The file is mapped when the reader is constructed, so reading a region is
 * the transfer and nothing else. Everything the reader reports is settled at
 * that point and reading does not change it, which is what lets @ref read be
 * called concurrently: the mapping and what a call resolves are the only
 * state a read touches, and the latter is not shared across calls.
 *
 * A read asks for the stretches it is about to touch before it touches them,
 * a step ahead of the one it is walking. See @ref image_prefetch_schedule,
 * which works out what those stretches and steps are.
