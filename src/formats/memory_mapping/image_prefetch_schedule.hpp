/**
 * @brief The stretches of a file a set of regions reaches, grouped into
 * steps.
 *
 * Regions are advised as the stretches they actually touch rather than as
 * the one span that covers them, so regions scattered over a large file ask
 * for what they reach and not for the file. Stretches that overlap or that
 * lie within the tolerance of each other are merged, which collapses
 * consecutive regions back into the few stretches they are. Merging stops
 * where a stretch would grow past the budget of a step, so a long run of
 * consecutive regions is advised a step at a time rather than all at once.
 *
 * Every stretch starts on a page boundary and ends within the mapping, so it
 * can be advised as it is.
 *
 * The merged stretches are grouped into steps of a bounded number of bytes,
 * so that one step can be advised while the one before it is walked.
 * Regions that fit in the budget are one step, so small scattered regions
 * are all advised before any of them is walked, and their latencies
 * overlap. A step always holds at least one region, so a region wider than
 * the budget is advised whole.
 *
 * The steps tile the regions: every region belongs to exactly one of them,
 * so walking the steps walks every region. A region there is nothing to ask
 * for, one that starts past what is mapped, still belongs to a step, since
 * advice is what this decides and moving the values is not.
 *
 * The file offsets this is built from must be ascending.
