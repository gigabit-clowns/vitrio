 * @brief Check that every region of a plan fits the file and the array it

 * @param regions The regions to check.
 * @param file What the file holds.
 * @param array_extents Extents of the array.
 * @param array_strides Distance between consecutive elements of the array
 * along each axis, in elements.
 * @param array_offset Index of the first element of the array.
 * @throws std::invalid_argument If a rank does not match the plan or the
 * strides do not match their extents.
 * @throws std::out_of_range If a region is not contained in the file or in
 * the array where it is placed.
