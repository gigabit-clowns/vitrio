/**
 * @brief Where each region of a plan starts on each of the two sides.
 *
 * Every region of a plan has the same extents and differs only in where it
 * starts, so all of them are walked by one iteration space and only the two
 * base pointers move. This is that pair of pointer offsets, one per region.
 *
 * The pairs are held in ascending file order rather than in the order the
 * plan states them, so that the file is walked forwards and the regions
 * about to be touched form runs that can be asked for together. The index of
 * a pair is therefore its position in that order, not the one it was added
 * at.
 *
 * Resolving them is also where every region is bounds checked, so regions
 * that do not fit are refused here, before anything has been moved, rather
 * than halfway through.
 *
 * The extents and the strides the offsets were resolved from are not kept:
 * an @ref image_region_layout is what they become, and holding them here as
 * well would be a second copy of what it already carries.
