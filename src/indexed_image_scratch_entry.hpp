/**
 * @brief A scratch entry that stores its copy in an array.
 *
 * The entry holds some indices of the first axis of a file, for example
 * some images of a stack. The array stores them in ascending order, in the
 * data type of the file. The position of an index in that order is its
 * slot.
 *
 * The slots are split into runs of consecutive slots. All runs have the
 * same length, except the last one, which may be shorter. A run is loaded
 * from the file in one read. Storing a region loads every run that contains
 * a held index of the region.
 *
 * A region is read from the entry only if all its indices are held and
 * loaded.
 *
 * Each run has a flag in the storage, which records that the run is loaded.
 * The flag of a loaded run holds the modification time of the file. A flag
 * that holds another time does not count, so a run loaded from an older
 * version of the file is loaded again.
